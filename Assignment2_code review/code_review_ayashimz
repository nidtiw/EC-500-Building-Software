The coding style is clear and following coding standards. There are various specifications for mac and windows user which is very convenient so the user does not have to figure them out for themselves. That's great foresight on the part of the developer.

It is a little troubling implementing the code as there are too many arguments required to be entered on the terminal. I assess that it was done to give the user flexibility to customise the final video they will be using, but there needs to be a tradeoff. Too much flexibility will make it complicated for the user to understand and they will have to assiduously go through your code to interpret what information they are required to provide. So a little less flexibility is recommended.

The developer has looked out for all kinds of errors which is amazing. I couldn't find any area which the developer has not accounted for.

However, the developer has used python 2.7 syntax and I needed to go and change all the print statements before executing the code.
